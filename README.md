Objective of the HelloToast exercise: Create a simple Android application with two buttons and a text field. One button triggers a Toast message (short message), while the other increases a counter displayed in the text field.

Difference between ConstraintLayout and LinearLayout:

ConstraintLayout:

More suitable for complex layouts.
Uses constraints to position elements.
Ideal for screens of various sizes.
LinearLayout:

Easy to use for simple layouts.
Organizes elements in rows or columns.
Suitable for simpler arrangements.
Components used in the project:

Button: For the two interactive buttons.
TextView: To display the counter.
Toast: To display a temporary message.
Main steps of the Java code:

Declare the variables for the buttons and the TextView.
Initialize these variables in the onCreate() method.
Create methods to handle clicks on each button.
Associate these methods with the buttons via setOnClickListener().
